# Stripe Payment Processor with Real-time Notifications

## Overview

This Node.js application integrates Stripe for payment processing and uses Socket.IO for real-time notifications to the frontend. It handles payment intents and responds to Stripe webhook events, alerting connected clients about the success or failure of transactions.

## Key Features

- **Payment Intent Handling**: Creates payment intents to initiate transactions.
- **Webhook Processing**: Listens for Stripe's webhook calls to handle post-transaction events.
- **Real-time Communication**: Uses Socket.IO to inform the client about transaction outcomes immediately.

## Flow of the Application

1. **Payment Intent Creation**: The frontend sends a request to create a payment intent with necessary details like amount and currency. This endpoint initializes a payment intent on Stripe and returns a client secret to the frontend for further processing.

2. **Client-side Processing**: The frontend completes the payment process using Stripe's client libraries, which handle sensitive payment information securely.

3. **Webhook Reception**: After the transaction, Stripe sends event notifications to a predefined webhook endpoint in our application. This includes events like `payment_intent.succeeded` or `payment_intent.failed`.

4. **Real-time Updates**: Upon receiving a webhook notification, the server emits a corresponding Socket.IO event to the connected frontend, providing real-time status updates.

## Environment Variables

The application requires setting up environment variables to manage sensitive information securely:
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Your Stripe secret API key.
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: The secret used to validate received webhook events from Stripe.

Create a `.env` file in the project root and fill it with your keys:
```plaintext
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=

```

## Initialization

### Server Setup
The `index.js` file sets up an HTTP server and initializes middleware such as Body-Parser for JSON, CORS for cross-origin allowance, and routes.

### Socket.IO Initialization
The Socket.IO server is initialized in `socket.js`, which allows real-time bidirectional event-based communication. It is crucial for notifying clients about the payment status as soon as the server receives a webhook call from Stripe.

## Running the Application

To start the server, navigate to the project directory and run:
```bash
npm install
npm start
